# Horiseon--Digital-Marketing-Services

## Description

I used semantic HTML elements like header, nav, article, and others instead of generic div tags to make it clear what each part of my webpage represents.

I organized my elements logically, not just based on appearance, which makes my webpage more accessible and easier to manage.

I provided descriptions for all the images on my site to ensure that people using screen readers can understand the content.

I used heading elements like h1, h2, and h3 in the correct order, creating a structured hierarchy for my content.

I gave my webpage a descriptive title to let visitors know what it's about.

In essence, I've followed the rules to create a website that is accessible and user-friendly for everyone.


## Usage

Here is a screenshot of the webpage as it is intended to be viewed.
